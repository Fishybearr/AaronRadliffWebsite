  <h3 style="text-align:center;">The Home of Everything I Do</h3>
  <p>I'm Aaron Radliff and this is where I show off just about everything I do. I spend most of my time
    building weird games and trying to answer unimportant questions with programming. I'm very interested
    in software security and reverse engineering <i>(legally)</i>. I love to challenge myself
    by designing and dissasembling network based application and systems <i>(also legally)</i>. I spend the rest of my time
    hiking, taking photos, and 3d modeling. So there's plenty of that on here as well
    <br><br>
    You can find

        <li>project writeups</li>
        <li>small toys and tools</li>
        <li>my resume</li>
        <li>photography/3d renders</li>
        <li>video games I've made</li>
        <li>probably a few easter eggs</li>

  <p>All of my projects largely vary in complexity and scale. Some of these I made before I knew
    anything about data structures, code formatting, or even that there were other languages than c#. I keep most of my old projects on here
    as I believe the most important part of programming is understanding and appreciating how far you've come.
    That being said, I know most people do not want to sift through the code I wrote when I was 14.
    So projects that are not up to my current standards get moved to <a href="ToysandToolsPage/Toys&Tools.shtml">Toys&Tools</a>
    . This cuts down on clutter while allowing me to keep alive the projects that got me here today

  <p>As stated above, Toys & Tools are small or old projects that aren't up
    to my standards to qualify as a project. Most of these are small webpages that I made
    to solve a very specific task. Things like the <a href="gpaCalc.html">GPA Calculator</a>
    I still use pretty regularly. To summarize, enjoy these at your own risk

  <p>I've been cursed with this awful desire to be an artist even though I can't draw, paint, sculpt, sing, play an instrument,
    or do anything with my hands that doesn't involve a computer. So I naturally fell in love with photography and Blender.
    I am most definitely not very talented at either, but I think that's half of the fun. Sometimes it's just fun to pretend
    to be an artist
